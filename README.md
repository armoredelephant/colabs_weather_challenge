# CoLabs Weather Challenge App
This app was created for a challenge 

## Challenge:
- Create a “Current Temperature” page that fetches and displays the current temperature
at the user’s current location

- Add a “5 Day Temperatures” page to your application that fetches and displays the 5 day
forecast for the user’s current location. Display all of the 3-hourly forecasts within this 5
day period.

The user should be able to access this "5 Day Forecast" page from the "Current
Temperature" page. You may choose the navigation pattern used. For example, both
pages could be top-level tabs within your application.

Each row in the list should display:
- The forceast date and time
- The forecast temperature in Fahrenheit
- The OpenWeatherMap icon that represents the forecast weather conditions.
